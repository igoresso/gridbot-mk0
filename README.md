Welcome to **GridBot-MK0**, the **cutting-edge** (well, maybe not _cutting_, but definitely sharp-ish) robot simulation app! Have you ever wanted to control a robot on a **5x5 grid** with the latest in keyboard and touch controls? Look no further, because this is _probably_ what you've been waiting for your whole life. Maybe.

So, what can you do in this app?

1. **Move forward**: Takes one step forward in whichever direction your robot is facing. If it falls off the grid, we’re not responsible. Gravity is on your side.
2. **Rotate**: Spin that robot like a record! Face North, East, South, or West. Your robot’s sense of direction is better than mine.
3. **Keyboard & Touch Controls**: Whether you like typing or tapping, we got you covered. Control your bot like a pro.

⚠️ **Warning:** GridBot-MK0 has no spatial awareness, feelings, or the ability to understand the nuances of human emotions. It will faithfully follow your commands, even if they lead to the edge of the grid (but don’t worry, we’ll stop it from falling off).
